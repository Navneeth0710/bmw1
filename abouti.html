<h1>BMW i4</h1>
<p>Overview & Purpose<br>

The i4 is a fully-electric compact executive “Gran Coupe” / 5-door liftback from BMW. <br>


It’s aimed at buyers who want a balance of everyday usability, sporty character, and electric mobility. </p>


<h2>Specs & Performance</h2>

<p>Power ranges from ~335 hp in base rear-wheel-drive eDrive models to ~536 hp in top AWD “M” versions. <br>


Battery capacity: ~70.2 kWh – 83.9 kWh (depending on variant).<br> 
Driving range: ~483 km – 590 km per full charge (as claimed in some markets). <br>

Top speed around 190 km/h (depending on trim). </p>


<h2>Why Consider i4</h2>

<p>It delivers the electric-car advantages (quiet, zero-tailpipe emissions) while still feeling like a “real” BMW.<br>

Its Gran Coupe / liftback body gives more practicality than a typical EV “sedan”.<br>

Good balance of performance, comfort and everyday usability among BMW’s EV lineup.</p>

<h1>BMW i5</h1>
<h2>Overview & Purpose</h2>

<p>The i5 is the all-electric version of BMW’s 5 Series — a larger, more luxurious electric sedan meant to replace/augment the traditional 5-Series with EV powertrain. <br>


It aims at drivers who want electric mobility without sacrificing comfort, space, or luxury. <br>

<h2>Specs & Performance</h2>

<h3>The lineup includes:</h3><br>

eDrive40 (single-motor, RWD)<br>

xDrive40 (dual-motor, AWD)<br>

M60 xDrive (high-performance AWD) <br>

The M60 xDrive offers ~593 hp and strong torque, delivering very strong performance. <br>
The claimed driving range is around ~516 km (in some market data) depending on variant & usage.<br> 


Battery pack is large (approx ~84 kWh usable depending on spec) for a luxury sedan.<br> 


<h3>Why Consider i5</h3>

<p>Great balance: EV benefits + spacious cabin + premium luxury — a strong alternative to traditional 5-Series sedans.<br>

Good for those needing more rear-seat space / comfort (longer wheelbase, sedan body) than smaller EV sedans. <br>

If performance matters — M60 AWD variant delivers serious power along with EV efficiency.</p>

<h1>BMW i8</h1><h3>(Hybrid Sports Car — legacy model)</h3>
<h3>Overview & Purpose</h3>

The i8 was a plug-in hybrid sports-car from BMW’s “i-series” (though it’s hybrid, not purely electric).<br> 


It was meant to show what a futuristic, high-performance, sustainable sports car can be — combining combustion and electric power for performance + efficiency. <br>


Production began 2014; i8 was one of BMW’s most futuristic and iconic designs (scissor doors, aerodynamic styling, hybrid-powertrain).<br> 


<h3>Performance & Specs</h3>

<p>Combined system (gas + electric) output ~362 PS (or higher depending on model version) + a hybrid electric motor.<br> 


Top speed electronically limited to 250 km/h.<br>


In all-electric mode: modest performance (EV mode top ~120 km/h), main benefit was efficiency & reduced emissions for short trips.<br> 


Lightweight & aerodynamic design (low drag coefficient ~0.26) helped with efficiency and sporty handling.</p> 


<h3>Why i8 Still Matters</h3>

<p>It was a “halo” car for BMW — blending hybrid-efficiency with sports-car aesthetics & performance.<br>

Showed BMW’s vision of combining sustainability with performance — influencing future “i-series” EV development.<br>

For many enthusiasts, it’s still admired for its design, innovation, and pioneering hybrid-sports-EV concept.</p>
