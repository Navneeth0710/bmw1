<h2>BMW M3</h2>
<P>The M3 is the performance-tuned version of BMW’s 3-series sedan, developed by BMW’s motorsport division. <br>


In many markets: M3 comes with a powerful petrol engine and sporty tuning, delivering strong acceleration and “M-car” driving dynamics. <br>


As with other M cars, it emphasizes a balance of performance, handling, and everyday usability — but with clear “sports-sedan” bias</p>
<h2>BMW M5</h2>
<p>M5 uses a ~4395 cc petrol engine (often paired with hybrid/plug-in hybrid in latest versions).<br>


Power output: around 717 bhp (per one spec listing) with very high torque figures. <br>

Performance: 0-100 km/h acceleration in roughly 3.5 seconds; top speed (in performance configuration) — very high (on par with many super-sedans). <br>

Despite being a “super-salon,” M5 retains luxurious comfort and advanced tech — making it a “dual personality” car: daily driver + performance machine.</p>

<h2>BMW M8</h2>
M8 is the flagship performance-coupé / gran-coupé of BMW’s M lineup — combining supercar-level performance with luxury grand touring capability.<br> 

Engine: 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 (in competition-spec) delivering about 617 hp. <br>

Design & Character: As a grand tourer + performance car hybrid — it’s as much about refined comfort and style as it is about speed.</p>

<h2>BMW M2</h2>

<p>M2 is the “entry-level” performance coupe in BMW’s M lineup — smaller and more compact than M3/M5/M8 but offering strong performance and the M-car feel.<br>


In terms of positioning, it appeals to buyers who want a sporty coupe with BMW M heritage — but in a more accessible/smaller package compared to flagship M-models</p>
